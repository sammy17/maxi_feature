@W [XFORM-503] Ignored partial unroll directive for loop 'Loop-2.2.1.1' (maxi_feature/feature.cpp:32) because its parent loop or function is pipelined.
@I [XFORM-501] Unrolling loop 'Loop-2.2.1' (maxi_feature/feature.cpp:28) in function 'feature' partially with a factor of 8.
@I [XFORM-501] Unrolling loop 'Loop-2.2.1.1' (maxi_feature/feature.cpp:32) in function 'feature' completely.
@W [XFORM-104] Completely partitioning array 'boundingBoxes' (maxi_feature/feature.cpp:10) accessed through non-constant indices on dimension 1 (maxi_feature/feature.cpp:15:2), which may result in long runtime and suboptimal QoR due to large multiplexers. Please consider wrapping the array access into a function or using a register file core instead.
